f(i, j) = |A[i] - A[j]| + |i - j| can be written in 4 ways 
(Since we are looking at max value,
we donâ€™t even care if the value becomes negative 
as long as we are also covering the max value in some way).

(A[i] + i) - (A[j] + j)
-(A[i] - i) + (A[j] - j) 
(A[i] - i) - (A[j] - j) 
(-A[i] - i) + (A[j] + j) = -(A[i] + i) + (A[j] + j)

Note that case 1 and 4 are equivalent and so are case 2 and 3.

We can construct two arrays with values: A[i] + i and A[i] - i.
Then, for above 2 cases, we find the maximum value possible. 
For that, we just have to store minimum and maximum values of 
expressions A[i] + i and A[i] - i for all i.
