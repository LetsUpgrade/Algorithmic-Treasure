#### Problem Statement

Given a singly linked list and an integer K, reverses the nodes of the

list K at a time and returns modified linked list.

> > NOTE : The length of the list is divisible by K

    Example :

    Given linked list 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 and K=2,

> > should return 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 6 -> 5

> > NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified. Still have a doubt? Checkout Sample Codes for more details.

## Approach

Split the list into buckets of length K and then reverse each of them. After this you have to concatenate the buckets and return the list. To split the list into buckets of length K, use 2 pointers that are K elements afar.
