Reverse the digits of the number to make your life easier.

Maintain a carry which is initialized to 1 ( Denoting that we need to add one to the number ).
Run a loop on the digit array ( which is now reversed ), and add carry to the current digit. If the digit D exceeds 10 on doing so, store the last digit in current position ( D % 10 ), and make carry = rest of the digits ( D / 10 ). Continue the process till you have covered all the digits.
Now if at the end, carry = 0, we are done, and we can return the array.

If not, we need to add one more digit, with carry in it.
