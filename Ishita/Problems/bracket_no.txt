Asked in: Flipkart
Problem : Given an expression exp of length n consisting of some brackets. The task is to print the bracket numbers when the expression is being parsed.
 Input: The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. For each test case, there is a string exp containing the expression.
Output: For each test case, the output is the bracket numbers of the expression.
Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=S<=100
Approach: Take a count variable ,initialize it to 1 if there is a opening bracket add the count to a vector array A and push count ++ to a stack st and if there is a closing bracket add the top of the stack to the vector array A and pop the element from the stack. At last print the A.
Pseudocode:   count=1;
	for(i=0 to s.length()){  
		if(s[i]=(){ //opening bracket
			a.push_back(count)
			st.push(count++)
		}
		else if(s[i]=)){ //closing bracket
			a.push_back(st.top())
			st.pop()
		}
	}
	print(a)
