Problem:Given a string s, print all possible subsequences of the given string 
Input : abc
Output : a, b, c, ab, ac, bc, abc

Input : aab
Output : a, b, aa, ab, aab
Approach: Each character in a string will have 2 options wheather it is included in a subsets or not. So the total no of subsets will be 2^n-1 where n is the no of characters of a string . Now make all possible binary combinations from 0 to 2^n-1.Start from left (MSB) to right (LSB) of binary representation and append characters from input string which corresponds to bit value 1 in binary representation to Final subsequence string sub.
Example:
001 => abc . Only c corresponds to bit 1. So, subsequence = c.
101 => abc . a and c corresponds to bit 1. So, subsequence = ac.
Pseudocode-   void filter_chars(int n,char a[])
	int j=0;
	while(n>0)
	{
last_bit=(n&1)
		if(last_bit==1)
		print(a[j]);
		
		j++;
		n=n>>1
	}
void print_subsets(char a[])
    for(int i=0 to (1<<n))
		filter_chars(i,a)
