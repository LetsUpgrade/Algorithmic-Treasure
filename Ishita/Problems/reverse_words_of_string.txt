Problem:Given a String of length N reverse each word in it. Words are separated by dots.
Input:
The first line contains T denoting the number of testcases. Then follows description of testcases. Each case contains a string containing dots and characters.
 Output:
For each test case, output a String in single line containing the reversed words of the given String.
Constraints:
1<=T<=10
1<=Length of String<=2000
Example:
Input:
2
i.like.this.program.very.much
pqr.mno
Output:
i.ekil.siht.margorp.yrev.hcum
rqp.onm
Time and Space Complexity:
time: O(n)
space:O(n)
where n is size of string
Approach: Split the array into words using "."and store all the words into an array.Reverse each word and store it in a string and at last print the string with reversed words.
Pseudocode:String[] words = str.split("\\.")//using split func
            for (String word : words) 
            {
                for (int j = word.length() - 1; j >= 0; j--) 
                    revword = revword + word.charAt(j)
                revstring =revstring+revword+"."
            }
            Print(revstring.substring(0,str.length()))
