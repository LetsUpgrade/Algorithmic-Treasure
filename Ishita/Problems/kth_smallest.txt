Problem : Given an array arr[] and a number K where K is smaller than size of array, the task is to find the Kth smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.
Input:The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of testcases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines. First line of each testcase contains an integer N denoting size of the array. Second line contains N space separated integer denoting elements of the array. Third line of the test case contains an integer K.
Output:Corresponding to each test case, print the kth smallest element in a new line.
Example:
Input:2
6
7 10 4 3 20 15
3
5
7 10 4 20 15
4
Output:
7
15
Approach: Sort the array in ascending order and print the k-1 th element of the array.
Time and Space complexity:
Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(n)
Pseudocode: 	sort(a,a+n)
	                            key=a[k-1]
