Problem :Given an array of size N consisting of only 0's and 1's ,which is sorted in such a manner that all the 1's are placed first and then they are followed by all the 0's. You have to find  the count of all the 0's.
 Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. 
The first line of each test case contains an integer N, where N is the size of the array A[ ].
The second line of each test case contains N space separated integers of all 1's follwed by all the 0's, denoting elements of the array A[ ].
Output:
Print out the number of 0's in the array. 
Time and Space complexity:
time: O(n)
space: O(n)
Approach: Take count =0 and as the array is sorted start traversing the array from backwards and  count the no of 0's and if 1 is found break the loop and print count. 
Pseudocode:for(i=n-1 to 0)
		{
			if(a[i]==0)
				c++;
			else
		    {
		    	break;
			}
		}
             print c
