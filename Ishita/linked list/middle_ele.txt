Asked in : Adobe, Amazon, Flipkart
Optimised Approach -  Count the no of nodes in the linked list and divide by 2.The node present at that position is the middle element of that linked list. 
Time and Space Complexity : 
Time - O(n)
Space - O(n)
Pseudocode  :while(b!=NULL)
	{	
		c++;
		b=b->next;
	}
	c=c/2;
	while(c--)
		head=head->next;
	return head->data;
        where b is the node pointer to traverse the array and c is used to count the no of nodes
