Asked in : Adobe, Amazon, Flipkart 

Problem : Given a singly linked list of N nodes. The task is to find the middle of the linked list. For example, if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5 then the output should be 3.
If there are even nodes, then there would be two middle nodes, we need to print the second middle element. For example, if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6 then the output should be 4. 

Optimised Approach -  Count the no of nodes in the linked list and divide by 2.The node present at that position is the middle element of that linked list. 

Time and Space Complexity : 
Time - O(n)
Space - O(n)

Pseudocode  :while(b!=NULL)
	{	
		c++;
		b=b->next;
	}
	c=c/2;
	while(c--)
		head=head->next;
	return head->data;
        where b is the node pointer to traverse the array and c is used to count the no of nodes
