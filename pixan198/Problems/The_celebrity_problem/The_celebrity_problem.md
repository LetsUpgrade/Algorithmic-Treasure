### Problem Statement

> You are in a party of N people, where only one person is known to everyone. Such a person may be present in the party, if yes, (s)he doesnâ€™t know anyone in the party. Your task is to find the stranger (celebrity) in party.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N).

**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1).

#### Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

First Line of each test case contains a integer N denoting number of rows or columns.

Second line contains N*N space seperated values.

#### Output

ID of the person who is celebrity and -1 if there is no celebrity.

#### Sample I/O
```
Input:
2
3
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
2
0 1 1 0

Output:
1
-1
```

### Naive Approach

We will count two things about any person, first how many people (s)he knows in the party and second how many people know that person. We will store these values for every person and according to the problem, celebrity does not know anybody at the party but everybody knows h(im/er). So, we need to find a specific pair of values in the data we stored earlier, celebrity does not know anybody means it will have `0` for how many people he/she know value and everybody knows celebrity so it will have `n-1` for how many people know that person value, everybody knows except itself so, no. of people - 1(n-1).
