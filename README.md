>## ✍&nbsp; PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Many time, when an interview approaches, candidates start searching for different algorithms in different programming languages for practise. This project aims to build a website which will contain the codes along with the techniques and explanations so that it can be helpful for many.

>## 📂&nbsp; RELEVANT TECHNOLOGY
We will be using CPP and Python to code out the algorithms and will be using HTML/CSS and BootStrap to make our website.

* CPP
* Python
* HTML/CSS
* BOOTSTRAP
* Data Structures
* Algorithms
