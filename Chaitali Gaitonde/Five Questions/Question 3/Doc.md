#### Problem Statement

Given an unsorted array of size N of positive integers. One number 'A' from set {1, 2, â€¦N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find these two numbers.

Note: If you find multiple answers then print the Smallest number found. Also, expected solution is O(n) time and constant extra space.

    Example 1:

    Input:
    2
    2
    2 2
    3 
    1 3 3

    Output:
